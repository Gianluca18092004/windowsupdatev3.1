<DIV CLASS="SectionDiv"><A NAME="FAQ"><id id=x30>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</id></DIV>
<DIV CLASS="BoldHeader"><id id=x200>When a new security bulletin is available on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/" target="_new">Microsoft TechNet Security Web site</a>,
is it also available on Windows Update?</id><BR></DIV>
<id id=x201>There is often a delay between the time that a security bulletin is posted to the TechNet Security site, and when the security update becomes available on Windows Update. This is because new content is added to Windows Update on a scheduled timetable. While Windows Update makes every effort to release important security updates as quickly as possible, new content must be tested and verified to ensure that Windows Update offers you only the updates you need for your particular computer. Typically, updates for supported products appear on Windows Update anywhere from a few days to a few weeks from the time they are announced on the TechNet site. If you know which particular version of an update applies to your computer and you donï¿½t want to wait to get it from Windows Update, you can download the update directly from the security bulletin Web page. </id><BR><BR>
<DIV CLASS="BoldHeader" STYLE="padding-top: 5px;"><id id=x31>What is Windows Update?</id><BR></DIV>
<id id=x32>Windows Update is the online extension of Windows, designed to help you keep your computer up-to-date. Windows Update has a central catalog called Product Updates that includes new product enhancements such as system files, device drivers, service packs, and new Windows features. These enhancements are recommended to you based on what is needed for your specific computer.</id><BR><BR>
<DIV CLASS="BoldHeader"><id id=x35>What is Product Updates?</id><BR></DIV>
<id id=x36>The Product Updates page is a catalog of fixes, updates, and enhancements to Windows and many programs that work with Windows. You can browse through the catalog, select as many components as you would like, and download and install them straight from the Web to your computer.</id><BR><BR>
<DIV CLASS="BoldHeader"><id id=x37>Why do I get a message saying an ActiveX control on this page is not safe?</id><BR></DIV>
<id id=x38>This message is displayed when your security setting in Internet Explorer is set to High. For the Windows Update site to work properly, you must change the browser's security settings for the Internet zone to Medium or lower. To do so, click the <b>Tools</b> menu, then click <b>Internet Options</b>. Select the <b>Security</b> tab and then click on <b>Internet</b>.</id><BR><BR>
<DIV CLASS="BoldHeader"><id id=x40>What is an ActiveX control?</id><BR></DIV>
<id id=x41>ActiveX Controls are reusable software components that incorporate ActiveX technology. These components can be used to add specialized functionality, such as animation or pop-up menus, to Web pages, desktop applications, and software development tools. Windows Update uses ActiveX controls to check what software is installed on your computer in order to provide you with a correct list of updates and other software you may want to download.</id><BR><BR>
<DIV CLASS="BoldHeader"><id id=x42>What is the best resolution for viewing the Windows Update site?</id><BR></DIV>
<id id=x43>The Web pages on the Windows Update site were designed to be viewed at 800 by 600 or higher screen resolution. To set this resolution, click the <B>Start</b> button, point to <B>Settings</b>, and then click <B>Control Panel</b>. Then double-click the <B>Display</b> icon, and click the <B>Settings</b> tab.</id><BR><BR>
<DIV CLASS="BoldHeader"><id id=x44>Does information about my computer get transmitted to Microsoft?
</id><BR></DIV>
<id id=x45>No. Each time you go the Product Updates catalog, Windows Update uses a control to check for updates specific to your computer. This check is done locally on your computer to ensure the privacy and security of your data, and does not send any information to Microsoft.</id><BR><BR>
<DIV CLASS="BoldHeader"><id id=x46>How do I send my feedback to the Windows Update team?</id><BR></DIV>
<id id=x47>You can send feedback about this site to the Windows Update team by clicking <B>Write Us</B>, then <B>Windows Update</B> on the black toolbar at the top of each page.</id><BR><BR>
<DIV CLASS="BoldHeader"><id id=x202>What operating systems and programs are supported by Windows Update?</id><BR></DIV>
<id id=x203>Windows Update offers security updates that apply to Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, Windows Millennium Edition (Windows Me), Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Internet Information Server 4.0 (IIS 4.0), Internet Information Services 5.0 (IIS 5.0), and Internet Explorer. However, you are only shown the updates that apply to your specific computer. Certain server operating systems and server-based programs are not supported by Windows Update. </id><BR><BR>
<DIV CLASS="BoldHeader"><id id=x204>You mention that certain server products are not supported. What server products are not supported?</id><BR></DIV>
<id id=x205>Windows Update began as a Web site that offered updates for Windows customersï¿½ home computers. Over time, Windows Update has expanded its offering of updates to cover some server products (like IIS) that are being used more frequently in the home. However, security updates that are specific to such server products as Windows domain controllers, Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft ISA Server, etc. are not supported on Windows Update. Customers using these products should review the security bulletins at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/" target="_new">Microsoft TechNet Security Web site</a> for information on where to download updates for these products.
</id><BR><BR>
<DIV CLASS="BoldHeader"><id id=x206>Has Windows Update always provided security fixes and other updates for Internet Information Server 4.0 (IIS 4.0) and Internet Information Services 5.0 (IIS 5.0)?</id><BR></DIV>
<id id=x207>No. On May 23, 2001, Windows Update offered a cumulative package of critical updates for IIS 5.0 for the first time. While this package does not include all IIS updates released to date, it does provide a combination of the most recent fixes that were released between March 2000 and now. For updates that were released prior to March 2000, go to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/iis/default.asp" target="_new">TechNet page for Windows Web services (IIS)</a>.
When new security fixes or other critical updates for IIS are created, this package will be replaced with a new package, which will include both the new updates, and all of the fixes in the previous package. This way, no matter how often you visit Windows Update, you'll know you're always getting the most recent updates for your IIS products.</id><BR><BR>
<DIV CLASS="BoldHeader"><id id=x208>Where can I go to get information about all the security-related updates?</id><BR></DIV>
<id id=x209>You can view all security bulletins at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/" target="_new">Microsoft TechNet Security Web site</a>. You can also subscribe to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/notify.asp" target="_new"> Microsoft Security Notification Service</a> and receive e-mail alerts about recently released security bulletins.
