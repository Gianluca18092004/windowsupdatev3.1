# Windows Update v3.1 Restored
The Windows Update v3.1 (for Windows 95 and NT 4.0) and Windows Update v4 (for Windows 98, ME and 2000 pre-SP3 users) websites were shut down on August 22, 2011.
<br>Since August 4, 2022 Windows Update v3.1 can be used, but many do not have the resources or knowledge to restore the website locally, plus it leads to a long-term outdated and struggling with issues that may have already been fixed.

<h2>This website is hosted here for and due to:</h2><ul>
<li>Update Windows 9x and NT 4.0 operating systems</li>
<li>Save hours of configuration and headaches in configuring a copy of Windows Server.</li>
<li>Report the problem and when it is solved, anyone who visits the site will already have it solved.</li>
</ul>
